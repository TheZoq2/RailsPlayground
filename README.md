Github, why the fuck is there no way to turn off security alerts. This is a dormant playground repo that I very much don't care about, yet several times per month, I get alerts about security issues in dependencies.

I guess the only solution is to erase the whole repo. If, for whatever reason you're interested in the actual code, check `HEAD~`
